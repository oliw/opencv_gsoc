My OpenCV Google Summer of Code 2013 Repo

This repo contains **two** Markerless AR applications. One is for Desktop and one is for Android.

The Android application requires the following environment variables to be set in order to build it

*   NDK_MODULE_PATH - Path to parent directory containing markerless AR desktop project e.g. /Users/Oli/Code/GSOC
*   OPENCV4AROOT - Path to OpenCV For Android Project folder e.g. /Users/Oli/NVPACK/OpenCV-2.4.5-Tegra-sdk
